# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any issues you may find.
However, please note that the project you are referring to, which is built solely using HTML and CSS, does not have any server-side components or backend functionalities.
As a result, there are limited attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities.
In the rare event that you discover a security vulnerability that directly impacts the project's HTML or CSS code, please follow these steps to report it:

1. Submit a Detailed Report: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it and any relevant code snippets.
2. Contact the Project Team: Send an email to projectteam@example.com with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report". Please include all the information you gathered in step 1.
3. Allow Time for Response: The project team will review your report and respond as soon as possible, acknowledging receipt of the report and providing an estimated timeline for addressing the issue.
4. Cooperate in the Resolution Process: The project team may require additional information or clarification to fully understand and address the reported vulnerability.
   Please be prepared to cooperate throughout the resolution process.
5. Disclosure and Credit: Once the vulnerability has been resolved, the project team will coordinate with you regarding the disclosure of the vulnerability.
   We appreciate your responsible disclosure and may provide appropriate credit for your contribution, subject to your preferences.

Please note that since the project is limited to HTML and CSS, most commonly known security vulnerabilities, such as server-side attacks or database breaches, do not apply.
However, we appreciate your vigilance and commitment to keeping the project secure.
Thank you for your interest in the project's security and your dedication to responsible disclosure.
